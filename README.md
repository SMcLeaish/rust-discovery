# `Fork of Discovery`

## About This Fork

This is my personal fork of the Discovery book, which is an introductory text for learning microcontroller programming using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

- **Purpose**: I'm working through this book as my first foray into microcontroller programming.
- **Previous Rust Experience**: This is my second Rust project after completing [100 exercises to learn Rust](https://github.com/SMcLeaish/100-exercises-to-learn-rust).

## Current Status

- This repository is primarily for **tracking my progress** as I work through the exercises in the Discovery book.
- I do not intend to make structural changes to the project beyond my personal notes or adaptations for learning.
- The original documentation and licenses are preserved below.

## Original Documentation and Licenses

There are currently two versions of this book. Both of them provide an
introduction to microcontrollers and how to use Rust with them.
The first is older and uses an F3 Discovery circuit board, while
the second is newer and uses a micro:bit circuit board instead.

- Read the newer book, using a micro:bit:
  <https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit>
- Read the older book, using an F3 discovery board:
  <https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/f3discovery>
- Start working on the examples from this repository
- You've got questions?
  - Have a look at our [discussions section on
    GitHub](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/discussions)
  - Maybe it has already been answered
  - If not, start a new discussion
- You've found an issue?
  - Have a look at our [issues on
    GitHub](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/issues)
  - Maybe there is already a workaround
  - If not, please open a new one - or even better - a [pull
    request](https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery/pulls) for solving
    it
- Have fun and enjoy!
